Nitrogen is a Group 15, Period 2 Element and has an Atomic Number of 7. 
Nitrogen is a colorless gas/liquid and has an atomic weight of 14.000. 
It occupies 78.04% of the amount of air in the atomsphere while Oxygen 
just takes 20.9%.

The Nitrogen cyle is a biogeochemical cycle by which Nitrogen is 
converted into varous chemical forms as it moves from the atmosphere 
into marine life.

Nitrogen is introduced in the fish food. Ammonia is the excreeted by the 
fish. Nirtosomus bateria then convert the Ammonia into Nitrites. Under 
the ocean bed, Nicrobactor bacteria then convert Nitrite to Nitrate. The 
plants in the water then take up the Nitrates as fertilizer.

It is worth noting that fish realease 80% Ammonia via the gills and 17% 
Ammonia via the feaces.
